This spiders scan the Chilean juditial system in look for legal causes, civil or work related and then gives you the  case number and some other useful information.
Currently the first bot is conected to the server file, while the pjudspider it's not, that's due of it being hardcoded with test code so far and also some speed issues that I must adress.

The main idea behind this is being able to check if the person asking for a loan or the person you're about to hire has any legal issues related to the transaction about to hapen.

Any and all comments regarding functionality or ideas can go to my email mrmistergd@protonmail.com
Also feel free to invite me to your projects, always looking for interesting stuff to taint with my code!
